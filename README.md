# MyfirstJS
I honestly don't know how I did this. I think that I approached it the most difficult way possile . Worked my way into a corner and Jacob really came to my rescue and helped me work through the fact that all my characters were in arrays. I had to sweat  it out as I tried finishing it by linking the randomIndex into a string and then into the password. 

What I learned: This time through I finally learned to make use of console.log more of a habit near the end of the project. Clicking into the errors and looking at what it was telling me where I went wrong. After stuggling with getting my Array into a string on every pass. (I must over think things because it was easier than what I started out trying. ) I put a few of my attempts in to the comments lines so that I could remember what I tried before. I left them there to show myself how much work I put into this and what would not work in this scenario.

 Screenshot before pw generation: Well, my traditional way of getting a screen shot in a document is not working. If you could give me some pointers in the comments for my homework, I would be most grateful!
